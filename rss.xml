            <description><![CDATA[<p>Kevin came to Sonoma Valley Nazarene in August of 2013.  He is originally from Sandia Park, New Mexico and is the 4th generation in his family to be part of the Church of the Nazarene.  Kevin received his Bachelors of Arts in Religion at Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville, TN in 2006 and is currently working towards his Masters of Divinity at Nazarene Theological Seminary.  He was ordained in the Church of the Nazarene in 2009.
Kevin is an avid sports fan, enjoys a good book, and, when not at home or the office, can usually be found at the local coffee shop.  Above all, Kevin’s greatest joys are found in the blessing of his family.  He and his wife Megan have been married for 8 years and are blessed with three children: Mackenzie, Charity, and Judah.</p>]]></description>
